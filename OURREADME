What works:
    Update.
    Insert. 
        Insertion mostly works. Except for the special case that
        splitting the root node may cause memory corrupt(only happens with
        key size >=256).
    Sanity check. 
        Check for if it is a tree, if it is in order, if it is
        balanced, and if it has valid use ratio.

Extra credit:
    Range queries. 
        Simple interface provided in ./btree_range_query.cc.
    Deletion. 
        Only partially implemented removing a key value
        pair in the leaf node without merging nodes or removing an interior node.
